<h2>About</h2>
<p>Approaching noon on 28th June 2019 I wondered whether I had listened to David Bowie that morning. I had been listening to music on my way into work and I could have checked my Last.fm account but that seemed a bit too easy. I thought there should be a dedicated website to answer this simple yet intriguing question. Lo and behold, Have I Played Bowie Today was born.</p>
<p>The original website was simple and answered the question pretty much with one of two words; yes or no. I was momentarily satisifed until I wondered on what days have I played Bowie in the past. This was an even more intriguing question and one that I put on hold answering for half a year.</p>
<p>While I have used Last.fm for over a decade now and continue to do so, I very rarely actually interact with the website, checking my profile two or three times a year. I decided that I would revisit my Bowie conundrum and solve that by building my own website which would record my listening history.</p>
<p>And here you are. A more complex website now exists which displays some limited historical listening history and quietly in the background it is recording my listening history.</p>
<p>Hopefully by the summer the website will be open for anyone to join and start their own music diary. There are numerous other features I want to add over the coming year which will make the site more engaging and useful.</p>
