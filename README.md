# Have I Played Bowie Today?

Sometime in mid-June or July 2019 when at work I wondered whether I had listened to David Bowie that day. Originally this website simply said yes or no via connecting to Spotify. Since then it still answers that basic question but now lists all the tracks I listened to. There is still lot to do such as a design and tests but for now it works.

If you'd like to use / see the previous version look through the history.

- 2019 data has been scraped from Last.fm using [scropple-puppet](https://github.com/ihuntington/scropple-puppet)

Very much a work in progress.

## Notes

### 2nd April 2021

It has been a couple of months since I last made changes to the project and I didn't commit my changes at the time. I now have little idea as to what I was in the middle of doing. As a reminder to myself I changed the `URL` in `app/src/bookmarklet/__snowpack__/env.js` so I could run the bookmark bar locally.

I also changed the file paths in `app/src/bookmarklet/index.html` for both stylesheets to run locally.
